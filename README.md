# StS-SCP261Mod

This is a Slay the Spire mod based off of Gremious' Default Mod (https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase/wiki), and SCP261 (http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-261) as well as some other SCPwiki content.

Adds 13 potions, 1 event, and 1 relic.

Thank you Gremious, BaseMod, and the rest of the Slay the Spire Modding Community for creating and documenting how to mod this amazing game. :)
